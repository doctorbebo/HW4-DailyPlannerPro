# HW5-DailyPlannerPro

A daily planner is needed when trying to plan a successful day. This planner allows you to assign tasks to certain hours of the day and 
informs you when that task should be completed. With a daily planner, one can organized their day so that, meetings won't be missed and
tasks will not be forgotten.

The Tools I used were the basic tools. HTML was used for the basic layout of the page. CSS was used for the layout, and
JavaScript was used for the interactive elements. I also used local storage grab save tasks in the website. For the time mechanics. 
I used a library called “moment.js” This tool allowed my to access what date and time. This was vital because time was essential in 
programming the planner background color functions.

This exercise continued to grow knowledge in web development. I chose not to use any libraries except moment.js in order to
 challenge myself and to grow my skills of the basics. I understand libraries are helpful and make development faster, but
 I don’t want to rely on them.
